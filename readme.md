# Exploring Human Cognition and AI Algorithms in Constellations
 This is a project conducted in University of Tartu, in the course Artificial and Natural Intellince.

 It delves into the realm of constellation images, investigating the initial strokes people make when deciphering them, with implications for understanding human cognition and refining artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Leveraging a dataset from a precedent study, we modified the PsychoPy code and conducted an experiment, focusing on the first 30 seconds of participantsâ€™ responses. The data, encompassing screenshots, brush coordinates, and participant answers, formed the basis for an in-depth analysis. Our approach involved visually inspecting screenshots, categorizing participant responses, and refining an algorithm to replicate human stroke patterns. The algorithm, utilizing clustering and outlier removal methods, demonstrated proficiency, particularly in mitigating noise structures.
